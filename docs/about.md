My name is Tiffany Harrell. I currently am a Team Lead for Lenovo Premium Services Support. I also am 3 classes from finishing my degree at Wake Technical Community College. I am a gamer (PC, switch, and tabletop/RPG). 

I volunteer at Kramden and the Food Bank of Eastern NC.

In 2017 I suddenly lost my husband to a heart attack. I was previously a stay at home mom who built/fixed computers and did web mark up and scripting to make extra money. I enrolled at WTCC following the death of my husband. I had 5 amazing children with my husband - including a set of triplet daughters. I work hard everyday both at home and work. 

Life has challenges, but in those darkest times, when there doesn't seem to be a way out, just take the first step. Don't give up.

I have many accomplishments and awards from work and school. My LinkedIn is up to date on all my latest certifications as well.
